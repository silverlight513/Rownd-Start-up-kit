#Rownd Start Up Kit

> A boilerplate for Rownd.js for project structure with grunt for quick and easy setting up.

##Getting started

Install all of the [npm](http://npmjs.com) dependencies using the below command

```shell
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed then run grunt to build the project ready for a server.

```shell
grunt
```

##Project Structure

The working folder of the project is contained inside the `app/` directory. Inside there are the controllers, helpers, images, styles and views directorties and your index.html and routes.js file.

When running grunt all of your files get built and moved into the dist folder. The contents of the dist folder is what you will need to put onto your server.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
